introductory portfolio

Please have a look at my portfolio on the following link:

https://itlancer999.github.io/portfolio/

It is a fully responsive layout with an introductory details on it. I am still working on it to make it full functional. Some of the test assignments I have completed during the course of (Modern Web Design and Developement) on https://www.freecodecamp.org/. One of the layout is (Accounting / Book Keeping) the one on which I am still working.
